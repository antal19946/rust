MODULE: 14_rl_training
GOAL: Introduce a future enhancement where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to train a reward model that guides the bot to pick the most profitable and safest arbitrage paths based on historical success.

---

WHY RL FOR ARBITRAGE?

- Some routes:
    - Consistently yield better profit
    - Fail less (due to gas, slippage, MEV)
- RL allows the bot to learn which:
    - Tokens are most profitable
    - Paths result in stable returns
    - Swaps are consistently safe

---

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING LOOP:

| Component   | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Agent       | The bot choosing routes (action selector)     |
| State       | Current token reserves, pool fees, volatility |
| Action      | Route: path + amounts + DEX types             |
| Reward      | Profit in USDT (post-gas, post-tax)           |
| Policy      | Strategy used to choose next route            |

---

DATA TO COLLECT (for training):

- Path used (tokens, pool addresses, DEX type)
- Simulated vs Real profit
- Gas used
- Slippage hit
- Token taxes or traps
- TX success/fail

---

REWARD EXAMPLES:

```text
+10 → profitable swap
+5  → profitable but high tax
-10 → TX reverted
-20 → honeypot
+2  → passed callStatic but low ROI
```

---

MODEL DESIGN (FUTURE):

- Input vector:
    - Token path IDs
    - Pool fees
    - Last trade volume
    - Token transfer_tax

- Output:
    - Expected reward score
    - Action confidence

Train using:
- Q-learning
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- Simple policy gradient

---

INFERENCE USAGE:

Before simulation:
- Use model to score 1000+ candidate paths
- Simulate only top 10 with highest expected reward
- Save huge compute time, avoid bad routes

---

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:

1. Start logging `ExecutionLog` after every trade
2. Build dataset → CSV or JSONL format
3. Train model with PyTorch / TensorFlow offline
4. Export model
5. Integrate inference layer in Rust (via FFI or JSON bridge)

---

CAUTION:

- Don’t let RL override safety checks
- Always apply honeypot + slippage filters post-inference

---

OUTCOME:

- ✅ Smart path selection
- ✅ Self-optimizing bot
- ✅ Reduced gas waste and failed TX
- ✅ Learning from own trade history
